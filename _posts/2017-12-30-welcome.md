Hello there, I'm **vorixo** and I will be your main host in **Devtricks**!

Devtricks was created under the necessity of completion. Two days before writing this post, I was researching about input responsivity in Unreal Engine 4, and I was ashamed, the information available about that topic at the date was almost non-existent. 

That made me ask myself - Why don't I write aswell? - well, so here we are! 

## What to expect

**Devtricks** is a blog that will teach you certain tricks about game development in general, more focused in Unreal Engine 4 (but this is open to all the readers). 

We will try to treat every single topic regarding game programming, from the most subtle things, to the most importants. We are very happy to have you as a reader, and please, enjoy.

## Thanks to

[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com){:target="_blank"}: Mainly because it's a nice way of having GitHub Pages host it for free but also because it's a great static-site engine we wanted to try out.

[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/){:target="_blank"}: The theme we will be using with this webpage, which is really easy to use and, it's responsive!

[codigScars](http://coding-scars.com/){:target="_blank"}: Thanks to Carlos Fraguas (gracias Carlos! :D) in advance, not only because his blog is awesome to read (which I recommend), but for the fact that this webpage was created using the same framework he suggests on his site, and as you can see, works really well!
