Unreal Engine introduced Physics prediction in 5.3, this post showcases a little demo project using it.

# Introduction

Wow! I didn't see that coming! Epic Games introduced an **experimental** Physics prediction feature in 5.3, so... let's take a look.

In order to activate the feature, open `Project Settings` and within the `Physics Tab`, turn on `Enable Physics Prediction`.

There are other settings you might want to explore!

## How does it work?

The following video I've recorded showcases the state of the system at the release date of UE 5.3 Preview.

Hopefully a future me will be able to see in the future a much improved version of what was disaplayed in the video!

# Conclusion

Thanks for watching! 

Hopefully you are as hyped as I am with this new feature! :)
