"77 Attempts" is a 64K Amstrad CPC video game powered by CPCTelera. This platforming adventure draws inspiration from the iconic "Super Meat Boy." Players assume the role of Alex, a charming character on a quest to rescue his beloved, the queen of gravity, who has been abducted by the nefarious villain, Attempo. Attempo seeks to harness her powers to reverse the planet's gravity.

With Attempo conveniently on vacation, our hero seizes the opportunity to embark on a daring rescue mission. Along the way, Alex must outmaneuver Attempo's malevolent henchmen and navigate treacherous traps set by the dastardly villain.
